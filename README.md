# Reimagining L.A. Job Ads: Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, and a move toward Multimedia
## Reimagining City of Los Angeles' Job Ads
### Project by Christopher Castano and Matt Savoca
<br>
#### In this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/) , part of the [“Data Science for Good” series](https://www.kaggle.com/data-science-for-good/overview), participants were asked to analyze the content, tone, and format of 600+ Job Descriptions from the City of Los Angeles and asked to suggest changes that could increase the quality, inclusivity, and diversity of the applicant pool. 
<br>
#### Our submission utilizes several unsupervised	machine learning models, applies sentiment analysis, and tests reading ease using a variety of approaches. Finally, we present a novel method to utilize deep learning and bi-directional word embeddings (BERT) and the package `moviepy` to quickly convert job ads into video ads suited for social networking sites.
